# Commuting-probability-in-finite-groups (Basque)
Although I currently work in Data Science, my training is in mathematics, which is why I’m deeply drawn to theoretical and abstract areas of the field. This Bachelor’s thesis explores the commuting probability of finite groups, the chance that two uniformly random elements commute, and how it measures how close a group is to being abelian. Along the way, it builds the core algebraic machinery (commutators, derived/lower central series, conjugacy classes and centralizers), develops explicit formulas and meaningful bounds and connects the topic to graph theory through commuting graphs, with detailed case studies (dihedral, semidihedral, quaternion and symmetric groups). Beyond the results, this project significantly strengthened my research skills: reading and synthesizing theory, structuring rigorous proofs and turning abstract ideas into coherent mathematical arguments.
